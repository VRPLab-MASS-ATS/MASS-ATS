# Maritime Aurtonomous Surface Shipping - Arctic Teleoperation Simulation

The Maritime Autonomous Surface Ship - Arctic Teleoperation Simulation (MASSATS) is a project built by the Virtual Reality & Perception Lab at York University's Lassonde School of Engineering. The purpose of this simulation was to examine how immersion impacts various human factors variables in remote monitoring scenarios.

The simulation is designed for three different levels of immersion to be tested on:
  1. Non-immersive Virtual Reality (NVR)    --   A standard multi-monitor desktop setup
  2. Semi-immersive Virtual Reality (SVR)   --   A modified CAVE system
  3. Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR)        --   An Oculus Quest2 HMD

The key variables this simulation examines are Situational Awareness, Trust, and Motion Sickness (MS). Situational Awareness is measured through a variety of ground truth variables being Activation Time (SA-AT), Percent Correct (SA-PC), and Reaction Time (SA-RT). All data is automatically recorded by the simulation and saved to a time stamped CSV file for statistical analysis.
